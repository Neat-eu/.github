# Our vision

At Neat, we create turnkey onboard insurance solutions for all distributors.
We provide retailers with next generation embedded insurance so that they can simply offer this high value-added service to their customers with tailored offers.

We combine state-of-the-art technology and human integrations so clients are efficently covered and merchants can focus on what they do best: selling!

# Our mission

Our mission is to promote more sustainable consumption through our services.

Protecting products extends their lifespan and therefore reduces their environmental and social impact in a sustainable way.

We promote repair and reconditioning rather than the purchase of new equipment.

With Neat, reduce the environmental impact of your purchases, and contribute to a more sustainable and responsible consumption that protects the planet.
